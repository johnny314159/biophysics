# biophysics
Hello my name is Johnny Liu and I am a student at McGill.
All my classes have coding this semester which is why I'm using GitHub, although only in one of these classes do I need to submit code alongside assignmentsm which is PHYS 319 (Biophysics).

A little about myself:

-11:59 deadlines are spooky

-I like to cook!

Thanks for reading, bye!
